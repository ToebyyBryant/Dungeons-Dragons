                    <h2>Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) is a tabletop role-playing game (RPG) where players create fictional characters and embark on adventures in a shared imaginary world. The game is typically guided by a Dungeon Master (DM), who acts as the storyteller and referee, controlling the game world, its inhabitants, and events. D&D encourages collaboration, creativity, and imagination, making it one of the most iconic and influential tabletop games.</h2>
                    <h3>Recently made popular by the movie "Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves" as well as some popular youtube Live Plays. My personal favorite is Critical Role which features a crew a voice actors some of which you've no doubt heard them (even if you didnt realize it.)</h3>
                    <p>Dungeons & Dragons (commonly abbreviated as D&D or DnD) is a fantasy tabletop role-playing game (TTRPG) originally created and designed by Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson. The game was first published in 1974 by Tactical Studies Rules (TSR). It has been published by Wizards of the Coast, later a subsidiary of Hasbro, since 1997. The game was derived from miniature wargames, with a variation of the 1971 game Chainmail serving as the initial rule system. D&D's publication is commonly recognized as the beginning of modern role-playing games and the role-playing game industry, which also deeply influenced video games, especially the role-playing video game genre.</p>
